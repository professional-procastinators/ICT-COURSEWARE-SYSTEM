    full_description: {firstp:"Hard disk drives are non-volatile magnetic storage devices capable of remembering vast amounts of data. An electromagnet in the read/write head charges the disk’s surface with either a positive or negative charge, this is how binary 1 or 0 is represented.",secondp:"The read/write head is then capable of detecting the magnetic charges left on the disk’s surface, this is how data is read. The disk surface is divided into concentric circles (tracks) and sectors (wedges).  Dividing the surface in this way provides physical addresses to remember where data is saved. A circuit board carefully co-ordinates the rotating disk and swinging actuator arm to allow the read/write head to access any location very quickly. Typical HDD capacities are measured in Terabytes (TB).  They can be installed inside a computer or purchased in a portable (external) format, It records information through magnetization. To enable the computer to read the disk, it is inserted into the disk drive.", thirdp:" When you save data or install programs on your computer, the information is typically written to your hard disk. The hard disk is a spindle of magnetic disks, called platters, that record and store information. Because the data is stored magnetically, information recorded to the hard disk remains intact after you turn your computer off. This is an important distinction between the hard disk and RAM, or memory, which is reset when the computer's power is turned off. The hard disk is housed inside the hard drive, which reads and writes data to the disk. The hard drive also transmits data back and forth between the CPU and the disk. When you save data on your hard disk, the hard drive has to write thousands, if not millions, of ones and zeros to the hard disk. It is an amazing process to think about, but may also be a good incentive to keep a backup of your data."},

    full_description: {firstp:"RAM is made up of small memory chips that form a memory module. These modules are installed in the RAM slots on the motherboard of your computer.",secondp:"Every time you open a program, it gets loaded from the hard drive into the RAM. This is because reading data from the RAM is much faster than reading data from the hard drive. Running programs from the RAM of the computer allows them to function without any lag time. The more RAM your computer has, the more data can be loaded from the hard drive into the RAM, which can effectively speed up your computer. In fact, adding RAM can be more beneficial to your computer's performance than upgrading the CPU.The RAM chip may be individually mounted on the motherboard or in sets of several chips on a small board connected to the motherboard. Older memory types were in the form of chips called dual in-line package (DIP). Although DIP chips are still used today, the majority of memory is in the form of a module, a narrow printed circuit board attached to a connector on the motherboard. The three main memory circuit boards types containing chips are: RIMMs (Rambus in-line memory modules), DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules) and SIMMs (single in-line memory modules). Most motherboards today use DIMMs.", thirdp:"There are two main types of RAM: dynamic random access memory (DRAM), or Dynamic RAM, and static random access memory (SRAM). The RAM in most personal computers (PC’s) is Dynamic RAM. All dynamic RAM chips on DIMMs, SIMMs or RIMMs have to refresh every few milliseconds by rewriting the data to the module. Static RAM (SRAM) is volatile memory and is often used in cache memory and registers because it is a lot faster and does not require refreshing like Dynamic RAM. SRAM retains information and is able to operate at higher speeds than DRAM. Because DRAM is a lot cheaper than SRAM, it's common to see PC manufacturers use DRAM. Dynamic RAM is memory that needs refreshing. The refreshing is done by the memory controller which is part of the chipset on the motherboard. Static RAM (SRAM) does not need refreshing and is used in memory cache on the central processing unit (CPU); it is called L1, L2 and L3 cache. Original SRAM was stored on the motherboard; later SRAM was inside of the CPU housing or stored on both the motherboard and inside of the CPU."},

    full_description: {firstp:"The first CDs were audio CDs, which eventually replaced audio tapes (which earlier replaced records). Audio CDs have the advantage of allowing the user to jump to different places on the disc.",secondp:"compact discs are used to store data so that may be retrieved or executed at a later date. CDs can store software programs so that you may load them onto your computer. They save files for backup or transfer to another computer, as well as hold music to play in a CD player. The standard CD is capable of holding 72 minutes of music or 650 MB of data. An 80 minute CD is capable of holding 700 MB of data. Several years after the CD was first introduced in the 1980's there have been other methods of storing and retrieving data. However, the most common replacement for the CD today is DVD and Blu-ray discs. For larger storage, jump drives are also a popular replacement to the CD.", thirdp:"As other technologies flourish, the CD has seen a steady decline in use, particularly during the early 2010s.  Digital formats have overtaken CDs in the music world, which has seen a huge shift away from physical mediums with the rise of streaming audio and digital downloads. While compact disc sales were more profitable for those in the music industry, convenience and low costs have fewer consumers turning to the physical medium. When compact discs were initially on the rise, PCs could only store approximately 10 MB of data, which had many turning to the CD for storage. That is no longer the case. With higher capacity hard drives and online storage options consistently entering the market, compact discs and tape cartridges are no longer the top choice for many consumers."},

    name: "Read-Only Memory",
    description: "A ROM is a storage medium that is used with computers and other electronic devices.",
    imageSource: "img/rom.png",
    full_description: {firstp:"Data stored in ROM may only be read. It is either modified with extreme difficulty or not at all. ROM is mostly used for firmware updates.",secondp:"ROM is memory containing hardwired instructions that the computer uses when it boots up, before the system software loads. In PCs, the instructions are read from a small program in the ROM, called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).  It contains the programming needed to start a PC, which is essential for boot-up; it performs major input/output tasks and holds programs or software instructions. Because ROM is read-only, it cannot be changed; it is permanent and non-volatile, meaning it also holds its memory even when power is removed. By contrast, random access memory (RAM) is volatile; it is lost when power is removed. There are numerous ROM chips located on the motherboard and a few on expansion boards. The chips are essential for the basic input/output system (BIOS), boot up, reading and writing to peripheral devices, basic data management and the software for basic processes for certain utilities.", thirdp:" One of the original forms of non-volatile memory was mask-programmed ROM. It was designed for specific data such as bootstrap, which contains the startup code. Mask-programmed ROM can never be changed. Because ROM cannot be changed and is read-only, it is mainly used for firmware. Firmware is software programs or sets of instructions that are embedded into a hardware device. It supplies the needed instructions on how a device communicates with various hardware components. Firmware is referred to as semi-permanent because it does not change unless it is updated. Firmware includes BIOS, erasable programmable ROM (EPROM) and the ROM configurations for software. ROM may also be referred to as maskROM (MROM). MaskROM is a read-only memory that is static ROM and is programmed into an integrated circuit by the manufacturer. An example of MROM is the bootloader or solid-state ROM, the oldest type of ROM."},

    full_description: {firstp:"Flash drives have many names — jump drives, thumb drives, pen drives, and USB keychain drives. Regardless of what you call them, they all refer to the same thing, which is a small data storage device that uses flash memory and has a built-in USB connection.",secondp:"Flash drives are typically no more than two to three inches in length and less than an inch in width. Their size and shape may resemble a thumb or a small pen (which is where the names thumb drive and pen drive come from). Flash drives are also very thin, often having a depth of less than a centimeter. Because of their small form factor, they are highly portable and can easily fit in a pocket or on a keychain (hence the name keychain drive). Early flash drives could store only a few megabytes of data, but modern flash drives can store several gigabytes of information. Since they are small in size but have large storage capacities, flash drives have replaced most previous portable data storage mediums such as floppy disks and removable hard disks like Zip disks. Because they have a built-in USB connection, flash drives also don't require a special disk drive to be used. Instead, they can be used on any computer with a USB port, which nearly all modern computers have.", thirdp:"Based on the Universal Serial Bus mass storage standard, USB flash drives are supported by all operating systems and BIOS. Compared to optical disk drives and floppy disks, USB flash drives can store more data and also transfer it at a faster rate. A typical USB flash drive consists of a USB connector, which is well protected and electrically insulated inside a plastic or rubber case. A small printed circuit board with surface-mounted integrated circuits are found within the device's casing."},

    name: "Floppy Disk",
    description: "A floppy diskette is a type of storage media, capable of storing electronic data, like a computer file.",
    imageSource: "img/floppy.jpg",
    full_description: {firstp:"Floppy disks have an interesting name, considering they do not appear to be floppy. However, if you take the actual disk out of the protective casing, you will discover that the disk is, in fact, rather flexible. It is coated with iron oxide and stores data magnetically, just like a hard disk.",secondp:"A floppy disk commonly came in three sizes, 8 inches, 5.5 inches and 3.5 inches, becoming smaller as the technology advanced. The newer, 3.5-inch version used more cutting-edge technology and held more data than previous models, while the original 8-inch floppy drive was developed to load hardware-level instructions and/or data structures called microcode into the IBM System/370 mainframe. The 8-inch flexible diskette was read-only, held 80 kilobytes of memory and was referred to as a memory disk. Eight-inch floppy drives did not connect to the motherboard, but rotated on a turntable that was run by an idler wheel.  As the floppy disk advanced to a smaller 5.5- and 3.5-inch designs, the FDD changed as well. To accommodate a smaller floppy disk, an FDD had to make aggressive changes by matching the size of the floppy disk drive opening to the size of the floppy disk for compatibility. For many years, the majority of PCs and notebooks had a floppy drive. Using a floppy disk to exchange data between PCs was a standard method for many computer technicians. The floppy disk was one of the most common ways to store adequate amounts of data outside of a computer's hard drive for personal use because they were inexpensive and easy to carry. Floppy drives are mostly a hardware device of the past. Newer hardware devices have been introduced, including ZIP drives, CDs and USB. Today, floppy drives are usually not included on a PC, notebook or laptop.", thirdp:"In 1978, a 5.25 inch disk was introduced, which could hold a whopping 360KB of data. Later revisions of the 5.25 inch floppy disk could store 1.2MB. These disks were used in early desktop PCs, such as the Apple IIe. In 1987, the 3.5 inch HD (high density) floppy disk was released, which could hold 1.44MB after being formatted. These disks were a little more durable than the 5.25 inch disks and were also more portable. For the next decade, the 3.5 inch floppy disk became the standard means of distributing commercial software titles and backing up personal data. In the late 1990s, CD-ROMs began to replace floppy disks as the standard means of distributing software. A few years later, consumers began migrating to recordable CDs for backing up their data. Apple's original iMac, released in 1998, was the first mainstream computer to not even include a floppy disk drive. While it took several years, many PC manufacturers eventually followed suit. Now most software is distributed on CDs and DVDs and most people back up their data either on recordable CDs or USB flash drives. Floppy disks are finally becoming a thing of the past, which is good, considering they are notorious for losing data. Still, the floppy disk will always have a special place in the hearts and minds of veteran computer users as it was the data storage medium many people grew up with."},
